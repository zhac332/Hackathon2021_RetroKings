Description:
  We've created a videogame based on chess, where we've implemented interesting power-ups to the game.

Files:
  In the repository you will find the main files of the Unity project as well as an executable (compiled) version of the game.

How to play:
  It's the rules of normal chess! But in addition there is a point system, and as the game progresses you can accumilate points for your color. Once you have enough points, you can click the buttons on the left to buy any of the avaliable power-ups. This can be done at anytime as long as you have the points to buy the power-ups, and so this allows you to be very strategic in when you use them.

Running the game:
  The game can be run simply by downloading and running the executable.
